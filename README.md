# recipes

In this 'project', we did a very simple web page, where the first page of the website shows us a list of recipe, and when clicking on each recipe, it would take us to another page with a picture, description, ingredients and the steps to prepare the selected dish.

Pretty simple and straight forward, not a lot going on due to the simplicity of the layout. I tried adding 'alt' options on all images for accessibility, as well as making it more readable with different break lines and more titles.
