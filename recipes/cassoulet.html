    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This quick cassoulet recipe is a great combination of beans, smoked sausage, and vegetables in an easy one-skillet meal. We've been making this so long I can't even remember where I first got the recipe — even my teenage daughter and her friends love it. It's also a staple when we go camping. Serve with a green salad and French bread.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 carrots, diced</li>
        <li>2 stalks celery, diced</li>
        <li>1 small yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>½ pound smoked sausage, sliced</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can cannellini beans, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li> Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the carrots, celery, onion, and garlic; cook and stir for a few minutes, until onion is transparent. Add sausage to the skillet, and cook for a few more minutes to brown. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Pour in kidney beans, cannellini beans, and tomatoes; season with bay leaves, thyme, salt, and pepper. Cover, and reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 10 minutes, occasionally stirring until vegetables are tender. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Remove bay leaves and discard. Sprinkle parsley over the top, and serve. </li>
    </ol>
