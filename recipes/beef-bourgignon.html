    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p> Beef bourguignon (a.k.a. beef Burgundy) is a French beef stew braised in red wine and beef broth. It also prominently features onions, carrots, and mushrooms. The dish has become synonymous with French cuisine and was famously a favorite of Julia Child. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Wine</strong>: For true beef bourguignon, you'll need a red Burgundy wine that is produced in the Burgundy region of eastern France with Pinot Noir grapes. Quality counts, and make sure you don't use a bottle you wouldn't want to drink!</li>
